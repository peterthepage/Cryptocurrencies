## Overview
The goal of the project was to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze cryptocurrencies and group them by their features. The reason for the report is so that an investment bank can create a portfolio. The methods used to achieve this are as follows.
* Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
* Clustering data using the KMeans algorithm.
* Visualizing results with 2D and 3D Scatter plots.
## Results
After processing the data these are the results.
### 3D Scatter Plot
